# 🗄️ SQL Practice Runs

This repository contains my **SQL practice exercises (run 1–15)**, progressively built in difficulty.  
The queries were executed in **MySQL**, focusing on mastering foundational SQL concepts and gradually advancing toward more complex operations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Database: `customer`, `customer_dim`, `order_dim`
- Tools: **MySQL Workbench** **AWS Cloud**
- Structure: Queries are organized as **run 1 → run 15** with increasing complexity.

## 🧩 Practice Task Coverage

### **run 1–10**
1. Basic `SELECT` and `FROM`
2. Selecting specific columns
3. Incorrect joins (and identifying errors)
4. Correct joins with `WHERE` and dot notation
5. Using **table aliases**
6. Filtering data with `WHERE`
7. Sorting with `ORDER BY`
8. Aggregations with `GROUP BY` and `COUNT`
9. Filtering grouped results with `HAVING`
10. Full query with all clauses (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`)

### **run 11–15**
11. Aggregate functions – `MIN`, `MAX`
12. Aggregate functions – `AVG`, `SUM`
13. Combining functions with `WHERE`
14. Rounding results and `GROUP BY`
15. Using `TOP` (MS Access) / `LIMIT` (MySQL) for ranked results

## 📊 Learning Outcomes
- Mastered **SQL query order** (`SELECT → FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → ORDER BY`)
- Learned differences between **MS Access and MySQL** (`TOP` vs `LIMIT`)
- Gained confidence in:
  - Writing clean, structured queries
  - Using aggregate functions effectively
  - Understanding query logic flow
  - Handling grouped results and filtering
